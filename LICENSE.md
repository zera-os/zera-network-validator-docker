**ZERA Open Use and Revenue Sharing License (ZERA License v1.0)**

**Preamble:**  
This license governs the use, modification, and redistribution of software under the ZERA License. The intent of this license is to encourage developers to use, modify, and innovate with the software without up-front costs.

You are granted permission to use, modify, and distribute this software, provided that any modifications or derivative works comply with the terms of this (or newer) ZERA License.

By using, modifying, or distributing software licensed under the ZERA License, you agree to the following terms:

---  

**1. Use and Modification Rights**

- Any modifications or derivative works must be made publicly available under this same ZERA License

- Any changes or improvements to the software must be published in an open and accessible repository within 90 days of the modification

---

**2. Revenue Sharing and Compliance**
  
- The following revenue-sharing model applies to **any gross revenue generated from fees collected directly or indirectly as a result of executing ZERA Network code or its fee-generating derivatives**, or through any fork, derivative, or implementation that replicates or extends the ZERA Network's core fee-generating logic:

- A flat **25 percent** of all gross revenue collected from the network must be paid to the **ZERA Treasury Address** in a recognized currency or token listed under the Authorized Currency Equivalent (**$ACE**) schedule **if the licensee is NOT currently exempted under Section 8**

- **Gross network revenue** refers to all protocol-level fees or value captured directly through the use of the software, including but not limited to:

- Transaction fees
 
- Execution or gas fees

- Validator or sequencer payments

- Protocol service charges

- Automation or settlement fees

- Any on-chain value accrual mechanisms executed by ZERA Network code or its derivatives

- Revenue must be calculated on a gross basis, **prior to the deduction of operating costs, validator incentives, rebates, or redistributions**

- Any operator(s) (entities, protocols, etc) leveraging a fork, derivative, or modified version of the ZERA Network or its components must calculate, report, and remit this revenue on a quarterly basis.  Reports and payment confirmations must be published within 90 days of the end of each fiscal quarter, using a publicly accessible and verifiable method

**Clarification on Scope**:  
- This revenue-sharing requirement does **not** apply to applications or tools that merely interact with the ZERA Network code via APIs or interfaces, as long as they do **not** modify or redistribute any ZERA fee-generating components

- At all times you will comply with and adhere to the prevailing Privacy laws and Cookie laws in the jurisdiction(s) you are deemed to engage with

---

**3. Attribution Requirements**
  
- Any public-facing implementation, modification, fork, or derivative work of this software must include a clear and prominent attribution to the ZERA Network and the original ZERA software
 
- Attribution must include the phrase:  **"This Network technology is a modification of software originally developed for the ZERA Network, licensed under the ZERA License (vX.x)**

- Attribution may not be removed or obscured, and derivative projects must not misrepresent their relationship to the original ZERA project

--- 

**4. Breach and Legal Enforcement**
  
- In the event of a breach of these licensing terms, any holder of **ZERA** ($ZRA+0000) has the right to initiate legal proceedings against the violating party. To reduce frivolous actions, the following conditions apply:

- Prior to initiating litigation, the initiating party must make a good-faith effort to resolve the issue via mediation or arbitration
  
- A governance proposal authorizing legal action must be approved and recorded via the **$LEGAL+0000** contract on the ZERA Network

- If legal action results in a settlement, judgment, or awarded damages, the proceeds will be distributed as follows:

- **25 percent** to the individual(s) or group(s) who initiated and executed the enforcement action 

- **75 percent** to the **ZERA Treasury**

- The violating party must return to full compliance with this license, make all required payments (including retroactive), and publish proof of compliance

---

**5. No Warranty and Limitation of Liability**

- This software is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including but not limited to merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement

- In no event shall the authors or contributors be held liable for any damages or claims arising from the use of this software

---

**6. Reciprocal Ecosystem Access**

- Any tools, protocols, technologies, or software developed using this software - including through forks, integrations, or modifications - must be made available for **free use within the ZERA Network ecosystem**

- This includes the right of the ZERA Network to utilize, operate, integrate, or extend such technology **without fee, license, or restriction**, provided it is used within the scope or developed using code operating under this license

- This clause is irrevocable and survives regardless of licensing structure applied by the downstream project, provided ZERA code or derivatives are in use

---
**7. Fair Market Behavior and Fee Parity**
  
- Any fork, modification, or derivative work utilizing this software or its components must not offer usage fees or economic terms **lower than the equivalent fees charged by the ZERA Network**, where such a comparison exists

- In cases where the ZERA Network does **not yet natively offer a comparable service**, the fork or derivative must price its services in accordance with **reasonable market standards and general economic parity**, as aligned with the intended design and value proposition of the original ZERA Network model

- The ZERA governance process, via the **$LEGAL+0000** contract on the ZERA Network, reserves the right to review and contest any fee structures that are believed to violate this principle. Upon passage of a formal governance proposal, a **minimum fair-use fee** may be established for a given service or implementation

- If such a minimum has been set by **$LEGAL+0000** governance contract on the ZERA Network, any fork, derivative, or implementation subject to this license must update its fee structures to be **no lower than the established minimum**, and must do so within 90 days of the governance outcome becoming binding

- Failure to comply constitutes a breach of this license and will trigger enforcement under Section 4

---

**8. Micro-Scale Project Exemption**

To support innovation and reduce the barrier to entry for early-stage or low-volume protocols, this license provides optional exemptions for **micro-scale projects** from the obligations in Sections 1 (Use and Modification Rights), 2 (Revenue Sharing), 6 (Reciprocal Ecosystem Access), and 7 (Fair Market Behavior and Fee Parity), provided the project generates **fewer than 100,000 transactions in any rolling 12-month period**, measured as the **cumulative total across all ZERA-based chains, forks, or deployments operated by or affiliated with the licensee**.
  
Projects operating below this threshold may claim exemption from the above sections but must continue to comply with all other terms of the ZERA License.
  
**Automatic Compliance Trigger:**
Upon execution of the **100,000th cumulative transaction** within any rolling 12-month period across any related ZERA-based deployment, the exemption immediately ends. The project is then subject to full compliance according to the below.
  
**Scaling Compliance Requirement:**
The licensee must come into full compliance within **60 days** of crossing the transaction threshold. During this period, they must publish a public declaration acknowledging the threshold has been exceeded and provide a timeline (within a maximum of 60 days) for fulfilling the obligations outlined in Sections 1, 2, 6, and 7.
  
This exemption is intended to enable fair experimentation and grassroots growth across ZERA-based ecosystems, while upholding that projects which materially benefit from ZERA's technology fulfill their responsibilities to the base protocol as they scale.

---

**9. Single Licensee Per Project**
  
Each project or protocol may operate under **only one licensee identity** for the purposes of this license. Multiple affiliated entities, aliases, or deployments may not be used to fragment obligations or circumvent thresholds such as those defined in Section 8.
  
All forks, deployments, or instances materially controlled or operated by the licensee must be treated as part of the same licensed project for compliance and reporting purposes.
  
Attempts to evade license terms by distributing activity across multiple licensees representing the same project or protocol constitute a breach of this license.

**License Continuity Obligation:** The licensee must remain current with the most recent version of the ZERA License and all incorporated governance documents and decisions, including but not limited to the [Rules of Engagement](rules-of-engagement.md). Updates published by the ZERA Network become binding 30 days after publication, at which point licensees must adopt and comply with them.

---

**10. Prohibited Use**
  
The software may not be used, modified, or distributed in any manner that undermines or harms ZERA, the ZERA Network, its core infrastructure, governance, or foundational principles. Any such use will be considered a breach of this license.

---

**11. Governance Documents and Decisions**

The ZERA License incorporates governance documents and outcomes of ZERA governance processes as binding on all licensees. This includes, but is not limited to, the latest version of "[Rules of Engagement](rules-of-engagement.md)" incorporated herein by reference, and any binding decisions enacted through the $LEGAL+0000 contract or equivalent governance mechanisms.

Governance documents and decisions may clarify, interpret, or update the obligations of this license, provided they remain consistent with its foundational principles.

Licensees must comply with all governance documents and decisions within 30 days of their publication or effective date, unless a different compliance period is explicitly stated in the decision itself.
